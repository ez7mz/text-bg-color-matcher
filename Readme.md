This is a simple project to predict the color of text in case of a given background color. The project is divided into two parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is a simple React app that allows the user to select a color and the backend is a simple FastAPI app that uses a pre-trained (Home-made) model to predict the color of the text.
